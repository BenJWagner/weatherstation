# ERC weather station

This code was used to build a remote weather station for Ecosystem Restoration Camp Altiplano, based on an Arduino board. This repository includes the sketch for the Arduino Uno, and a simple Python server for logging the data and forwarding it to CWOP and Weather Underground.
